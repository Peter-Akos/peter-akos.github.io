title: Visualizing Culture with the Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory
---

The beautiful thing about data is, that we can use it to bring to the front of our eyes basically everything that we can measure. Even intangible things such as culture.

## How can we measure culture?

This was the question Geert Hofstede had in his mind when he started his research that would ultimately come up with a framework for cross-cultural psyhology. This means six dimensions, that can me used do describe the effects of a society's culture on the values of its members.
These 6 dimensions are the following:
- Power distance index (PDI)
- Individualism vs. collectivism (IDV)
- Uncertainty avoidance (UAI)
- Masculinity vs. femininity (MAS)
- Long-term orientation vs. short-term orientation (LTO)
- Indulgence vs. restraint (IND)
  
## What do these indexes represent?
### Power distance index (PDI)
Power Distance has been defined as the extent to which the less powerful members of organizations and institutions (like the family) accept and expect that power is distributed unequally. This represents inequality (more versus less), but defined from below, not from above. It suggests that a society's level of inequality is endorsed by the followers as much as by the leaders. Power and inequality, of course, are extremely fundamental facts of any society. All societies are unequal, but some are more unequal than others.

### Individualism vs. collectivism (IDV)
Individualism on the one side versus its opposite, Collectivism, as a societal, not an individual characteristic, is the degree to which people in a society are integrated into groups. On the individualist side we find cultures in which the ties between individuals are loose: everyone is expected to look after him/herself and his/her immediate family. On the collectivist side we find cultures in which people from birth onwards are integrated into strong, cohesive in-groups, often extended families (with uncles, aunts and grandparents) that continue protecting them in exchange for unquestioning loyalty, and oppose other ingroups.

### Uncertainty avoidance (UAI)
The uncertainty avoidance index is defined as "a society's tolerance for ambiguity", in which people embrace or avert an event of something unexpected, unknown, or away from the status quo. Societies that score a high degree in this index opt for stiff codes of behavior, guidelines, laws, and generally rely on absolute truth, or the belief that one lone truth dictates everything and that people know what it is. A lower degree in this index shows more acceptance of differing thoughts or ideas. Society tends to impose fewer regulations, ambiguity is more accustomed to, and the environment is more free-flowing.

### Masculinity vs. femininity (MAS)
In this dimension, masculinity is defined as "a preference in society for achievement, heroism, assertiveness, and material rewards for success." Its counterpart represents "a preference for cooperation, modesty, caring for the weak, and quality of life." Women in the respective societies tend to display different values. In feminine societies, they share modest and caring views equally with men. In more masculine societies, women are somewhat assertive and competitive, but notably less than men. In other words, they still recognize a gap between male and female values.

### Long-term orientation vs. short-term orientation (LTO)
This dimension associates the connection of the past with the current and future actions/challenges. A lower degree of this index (short-term) indicates that traditions are honored and kept, while steadfastness is valued. Societies with a high degree in this index (long-term) view adaptation and circumstantial, pragmatic problem-solving as a necessity. A poor country that is short-term oriented usually has little to no economic development, while long-term oriented countries continue to develop to a level of prosperity.

### Indulgence vs. restraint (IND)
This dimension refers to the degree of freedom that societal norms give to citizens in fulfilling their human desires. Indulgence is defined as "a society that allows relatively free gratification of basic and natural human desires related to enjoying life and having fun". Its counterpart is defined as "a society that controls gratification of needs and regulates it by means of strict social norms".

## Now that we know this, how can we visualize the culture of a given country?
The answer to this question would be trivial if we would be able to see in 6 dimensions, but unfortunately we can only see in 3. Furthermore, we are used to seeing countries represented on maps, so maybe it would be a good idea to represent these values on a 2 dimensional scale. Luckily, there are some dimensionality reduction techniques, that we can use to plot the countries in 2d.
