title: Visualizing Culture with the Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory
---
## How can we measure culture?

This was the question Geert Hofstede had in his mind when he started his research.  Embarking on a journey that would shape cross-cultural psychology, he crafted a framework comprising six dimensions. These dimensions act as lenses, allowing us to decipher the profound impact of culture on the values held by its members.

These 6 dimensions are the following:
- Power distance index (PDI)
- Individualism vs. collectivism (IDV)
- Uncertainty avoidance (UAI)
- Masculinity vs. femininity (MAS)
- Long-term orientation vs. short-term orientation (LTO)
- Indulgence vs. restraint (IND)
  

The beautiful thing about data is its power to unveil, making visible virtually everything we can measure, even intangible elements like culture.

If you are not really interested in what exactly these values represent, you can skip to the [data science section](#lets-get-to-the-data-science-part).
  
## What do these indexes represent?
### Power distance index (PDI)
Power Distance measures how willingly less powerful members accept unequal power distribution within organizations and institutions, highlighting societal endorsement of inequality from both leaders and followers.

### Individualism vs. collectivism (IDV)
This index explores the degree of integration into groups within a society, with individualistic cultures emphasizing loose ties and self-reliance, while collectivist cultures foster strong in-groups, often extended families, based on unquestioning loyalty.

### Uncertainty avoidance (UAI)
The Uncertainty Avoidance Index reflects a society's tolerance for ambiguity. High scores indicate a preference for strict codes, absolute truth, and resistance to unexpected events, while lower scores signify openness to differing thoughts, fewer regulations, and a more free-flowing environment.

### Masculinity vs. femininity (MAS)
In this dimension, masculinity is defined as "a preference in society for achievement, heroism, assertiveness, and material rewards for success." Its counterpart represents "a preference for cooperation, modesty, caring for the weak, and quality of life." Women in the respective societies tend to display different values. In feminine societies, they share modest and caring views equally with men. In more masculine societies, women are somewhat assertive and competitive, but notably less than men. In other words, they still recognize a gap between male and female values.

### Long-term orientation vs. short-term orientation (LTO)
This dimension links the past with current and future actions. A lower index values tradition and steadfastness (short-term), while a higher index emphasizes adaptation and pragmatic problem-solving, leading to prosperity in the long term.

### Indulgence vs. restraint (IND)
This dimension refers to the degree of freedom that societal norms give to citizens in fulfilling their human desires. Indulgence is defined as "a society that allows relatively free gratification of basic and natural human desires related to enjoying life and having fun". Its counterpart is defined as "a society that controls gratification of needs and regulates it by means of strict social norms".

## Let's get to the data science part
The primary challenge posed by this data lies in its multidimensionality. With six dimensions to visualize, we face the need for multiple plots or dimensionality reduction techniques. Considering our familiarity with maps representing countries, a two-dimensional scale may prove effective in illustrating these cultural values.
