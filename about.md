## Hi, my name is **√Åkos**!


I study **computer science** and in the last few years I did some **Data Science** and **Machine learning** projects. For the possibility that maybe others would find them interesting, I created this blog.

You can do a lot of cool stuff with data, but if you want to understand it, the best way is to vizualize it. 

## Resume

You can find my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13eYzF1GK92WQcuYF7h4AIT3hgEshL7V2/view). 

If you have some comments about the work I do or you want to work together, you can write me a message on LinkedIn or send me an email.
