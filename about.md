## Hi, my name is **√Åkos**!


I study **computer science** and in the last few years I did some **Data Science** and **Machine learning** projects. For the possibility that maybe others would find them interesting, I created this blog.


## Data Visualization

You can do a lot of cool stuff with data, but if you want to understand it, the best way is to visualize it. I like creating plots to really show what a dataset really contains. I believe that through the use of data we can understand reality better, and we can make informed decisions to face it. 

## Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

I think one of the most important things in life is self-reflection and learning from your and other peoples mistakes. I like machine learning because it is a way of extracting and generalizing knowledge from data, and I think it holds huge opportunities for humanity. I think AI is a tool that helps us and makes us more effective. 

## CV

You can find my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13eYzF1GK92WQcuYF7h4AIT3hgEshL7V2/view). 

If you have some comments about the work I do or you want to work together, you can write me a message on LinkedIn or send me an email.
